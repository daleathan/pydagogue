pydagogue sphinx doc hosting
===========================

This branch is used to host builds of the pydagogue sphinx doc. The actual code
is in the 'master' and related branches of this repo.

How to build sphinx docs
------------------------

To make a new build, simply run
::
    $ make gh-pages

or equivalently
::
    $ ./gh-pages.py

This will create a new build of the docs tagged by 'git describe'. To
make something tagged with 'current', simply do
::
    $ ./gh-pages.py current

It may be a good idea to simply use 'current' for any builds of current
development that haven't been tagged.
